Here we go round the mulberry bush
The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush
Here we go round the mulberry bush
So early in the morning

This is the way we bale the hay
Bale the hay, bale the hay
This is the way we bale the hay
So early Monday morning

This is the way we feed the chicks
Feed the chicks, feed the chicks
This is the way we feed the chicks
So early Tuesday morning

This is the way we sweep the porch
Sweep the porch, sweep the porch
This is the way we sweep the porch
So early Wednesday morning
